				<h1>Post #1: Birth of the Green Brick</h1><br/>
				<p>
		<p>This blog is dedicated to sharing my experiences as a game developer and founder of a game development studio. As it will be constantly updated with current events, it is aimed for anyone. Someone wanting to start a similair journey, someone on it, or someone who is simply interested in the story will hopefully have something fun or useful to take from the posts to come. I will not go into the technical details as I want this to be an easy read, but everyone wishing to know more is free to e-mail me.</p>
		<p>Green Brick Games has it's roots in 2014, when I first thought of making a 3d platformer. It was my first contact with Unreal Engine 4 and it's power that made me think that this really makes things easy, and I hoped that people will make more third person platforming games that used to be in the 90s. Instantly after that I realized that even I could be the one to make such a game with this kind of tool, even though I was just a 3D artist.</p>
		<p>Back then I had no programming knowledge. No idea what a function, or a data type is, but I slowly progressed while working on various games and projects that were being built in Unreal Engine 4 and Unity, with a few very knowledgable people so I learned a few things here and there, enough to spark my interest to start learning about it on my own.</p>
		<p>In the early 2017 I decided to start a game development studio called Green Brick Games, whose aim is to develop games with gameplay and art that made me fall in love in video games in the first place when I was a kid. The name itself is from a dream that I had, about a wall in an alley that had one green brick in it among all the grey ones. That brick had such a vibrant feeling to it, like it was communicating to me in a way that I could only feel vaguely instead of understand it. It was a dream from a few years ago, but that brick got stuck in my brain for so long that I decided to name my game development studio after it. I talked about that brick to people a lot, I don't really know why, it was fascinating to me for some reason. On a game jam, a great friend of mine Vukasin and I created a small game where the brick made it's first appearance as an "easter egg" of sorts.</p>
		<p>In the March of 2017, I started gathering a team of people who had no experience in developing video games, but had the passion for expressing their creativity. Vukasin is a graphic designer, so he created a logo for the studio, which is something I find very important. A banner for a group of people to gather under.</p>

		<p>A brainstorm group was created that would develop a game design document for the game. First member was Milica, a painter with great love for nature and high fantasy. One of the greatest things that happened to the studio was when she came to a meeting one day carrying an oil painting of a scene from Songs of Arcadia. The whole team stood there motionless in awe, because that was such a beautifal way to display someone's dedication.</P>

		<p>Then came Nevena, an old friend of mine who I met while researching dramaturgy when I was 17, she went through with that path and graduated on the topic. Now, 10 years later, I asked her if she would like to contribute to the project with her skills and creativity and she agreed kindly.</p>
		<p>Ceda is a great friend, a death knight, a show director and the wielder of the greatest humour I ever witnessed. He is the only true gamer in the group who always wanted to contribute to developing games. His is the domain of level design and boss mechanics, as well as some character concepts.</P>
	 	<p>There was no money involved, so there could be no industry professionals on the team, which was something I don't regret, because the brainstorms were so fun and open with the only boring border being me, because I knew the the technical limits of game development and the limits of my own programming and artistic power.</p>
